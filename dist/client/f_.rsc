1:T682,With his eyes fixed on the Castle, K. went on further, thinking of nothing else at all. But on approaching it he was disappointed in the Castle; it was after all only a wretched-looking town, a huddle of village houses, whose sole merit, if any, lay in being built of stone, but the plaster had long since flaked off and the stone seemed to be crumbling away. K. had a fleeting recollection of his native town. It was hardly inferior to this so-called Castle, and if it were merely a question of enjoying the view it was a pity to have come so far, K. would have done better to visit his native town again, which he had not seen for such a long time. And in his mind he compared the church tower at home with the tower above him. The church tower, firm in line, soaring unfalteringly to its tapering point, topped with red tiles and broad in the roof, an earthly building⁠—what else can men build?⁠—but with a loftier goal than the humble dwelling-houses, and a clearer meaning than the muddle of everyday life. The tower above him here⁠—the only one visible⁠—the tower of a house, as was now apparent, perhaps of the main building, was uniformly round, part of it graciously mantled with ivy, pierced by small windows that glittered in the sun, a somewhat maniacal glitter, and topped by what looked like an attic, with battlements that were irregular, broken, fumbling, as if designed by the trembling or careless hand of a child, clearly outlined against the blue. It was as if a melancholy-mad tenant who ought to have been kept locked in the topmost chamber of his house had burst through the roof and lifted himself up to the gaze of the world.0:{"root":[[["$","link","css:/assets/index-BoQsawTv.css",{"rel":"stylesheet","precedence":"vite-rsc/importer-resources","href":"/assets/index-BoQsawTv.css","data-rsc-css-href":"/assets/index-BoQsawTv.css"}],"$undefined"],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","meta",null,{"charSet":"UTF-8"}],["$","link",null,{"rel":"icon","type":"image/svg+xml","href":"/vite.svg"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}],["$","title",null,{"children":"Vite + RSC"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"children":"$1"}]}]]}]]}
